    <h1>About Inés Lozano Palacio</h1>
    <p>Inés Lozano Palacio (Logroño 1994) is a Spanish photographer, writer and filmmaker based in Logroño and London. After
    studying a BA in English Studies and a professional degree in Piano in La Rioja, she moved to London to pursue her
    postgraduate studies in Comparative Literature at Goldsmiths, University of London, where she also studied
    screenwriting. To these studies she owes her current interest and work as a screenwriter and a playwright. She is
    currently pursuing a PhD in Cognitive Linguistics and Literary Theory.</p>

    <p>The wide scope of her interests and studies has led her to understand art as inevitably interdisciplinary; she believes
    the evocative side of any artistic work makes it impossible to experience it through one single channel. She takes
    analogue and digital photographs both in colour and in black and white although she has recently focused almost
    exclusively in the latter. The philosophy behind her work is that of spontaneity. She sees the world as an unconsciously
    but carefully crafted cosmos where beauty resides in the things we never intended to make beautiful. Her most recent
    interest has been the genesis and symbolism of light.</p>
